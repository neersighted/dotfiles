# [fresh] ~/.dotfiles

> These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine.

Here you will find my dotfiles. They contain the configuration for many
programs I use, and reflect many months of tweaking on my part. Feel free to
pick and snip from them as you like. I suggest importing anything you like with
[fresh].

## Installation

``` sh
FRESH_LOCAL_SOURCE=neersighted/dotfiles bash <(curl -sL get.freshshell.com)
```

My dotfiles are managed by [fresh].
